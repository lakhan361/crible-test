HEC configuration: 
What HEC actually is

HEC (HTTP Event Collector) = an HTTP(S) endpoint that receives logs/events.

It requires:

A listening HTTP server (port 8088 by default).
    Token authentication.
    Optional SSL/TLS certs.

In Splunk world, HEC only exists on:
    Splunk Enterprise
    Heavy Forwarder
    Or Cribl Stream Worker (acting as a HEC-compatible receiver).



What Splunk UF can (and cannot) do
    Splunk Universal Forwarder (UF) is very lightweight.

    ✅ Can:

    Monitor files, directories, syslog, etc.
    Forward events to another Splunk instance, Heavy Forwarder, or HTTP/HEC destination.

    ❌ Cannot:

    Host or expose its own HEC input (there is no /services/data/inputs/http endpoint in UF).
    Process pipelines, filters, or transformations beyond basic parsing.



So when your Ansible role tried:
    POST /services/data/inputs/http ...
    UF replied with 404 Not Found because it doesn’t have that endpoint.


Why HEC goes on the Cribl Worker
    Cribl Worker is built to ingest events via many sources (including Splunk HEC).
    It runs a full HTTP server, so it can expose port 8088, manage tokens, and authenticate requests.
    Once Cribl ingests via HEC, it can:
    Route events to multiple destinations (Splunk, S3, Elasticsearch, Kafka, …).
    Apply pipelines (filter, mask, enrich, drop, transform).

In short:
    Cribl Worker = HEC input (receiver).
    Splunk UF = HEC output (sender/forwarder).

✅ Bottom line:
    UF is a “shipper” → monitors local logs, forwards them.
    Cribl Worker is a “collector” → receives logs via HEC and does the heavy lifting.
